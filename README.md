# Tensorflow speech recognition challenge

Inquire and explore steps in the data scientist pipeline including: data wrangling, data cleaning, and predictive modeling with AI. We will use the Speech Recognition data set, found on Kaggle.com, in order to build an algorithm that recognizes simple speech commands.
